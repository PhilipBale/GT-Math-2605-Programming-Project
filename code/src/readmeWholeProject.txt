The entire project can be run from a command line.  To compile, execute "javac *.*" in the src directory. To execute, run "java ProjectRunner".


To perform a specific task, type in its name when prompted.

The possible options are 

1. "lu_fact"
2. "qr_fact_househ"
3. "qr_fact_givens"
4. "solve_lu_b"
5. "solve_qr_b"
6. "solve_hilbert"
7. "convolutional_codes"
8. "jacobi"
9. "gauss_seidel"
10. "decode"
11. "power_method"

Each task will prompt you for certain input.  If it asks for a matrix, provide the path.  It is most simple to put the .dat file in the same directory, so that you can type in "x.dat".  If the matrix is attempting to solve for a certain b, simply augment the matrix in the .dat file.

If you have any questions, please email pbale95@gmail.com or call/text 302-275-1997.

Thank you!
